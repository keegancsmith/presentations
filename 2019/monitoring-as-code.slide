* Introduction

- Treating monitoring as code.
- The rules/alerts we have that can wake us up at night.
- Code == can apply devops principles to it.
- Prometheus
- Pingdom

* Background

- We ship our code into customer's data centers
- Either single docker image, or many kubernetes resources.
- Code search/intelligence product, so team that usually looks after it is devtools.
- They want monitoring on it.

* Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit with an
active ecosystem.

* Unit Testing

.code test.yml /tests/,/description/

* Continuous Integration

.code ci.sh

* Continuous Deployment

- Deploy config/alerts/rules on master CI runs.
- Prometheus supports reloading config without restart.

* Continuous Deployment: Kubernetes

- We store all rules as a configmap and update it in CI

* Pingdom

- External uptime monitoring
- Lots of alternatives
- Prometheus has `blackbox_exporter`

* Pingdom: but does it code?

- Not directly...

* Pingdom: but does it code?

- Not directly...
- But has an *API*

* Terraform

- Infrastructure as code - _terraform.io_
- Has providers (plugins)!

* Terraform + Pingdom

- https://github.com/russellcardullo/terraform-provider-pingdom

.code pingdom.tf

* Terraform + Pingdom + CI/CD

- PR `terraform plan`
- Master `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode`
- Lots of resources on doing the above better.
